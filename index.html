<h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
<h2>What’s a Customer Account Takeover?</h2>
<p>A customer account takeover happens when criminals steal customer information, 
  such as usernames and passwords, to gain unauthorized access <br>to personal accounts, 
  including online financial accounts. This can occur through phishing, social 
  engineering, data breaches, or malicious software.</p>
<h2>Preventing Account Takeovers</h2>
<h3>1. Watch What You Click</h3>
<p>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or responding to suspicious emails. Always 
  go directly to your financial firm's website or app to verify any information.</p>
<h3>2. Use Strong Passwords</h3>
<p>Create unique passwords for each of your accounts and change them regularly. 
  Use a password manager to keep track of and protect your passwords.</p>
<h3>3. Enable Multifactor Authentication</h3>
<p>Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for added security. MFA requires two or 
  more types of verification, such as a password and a code sent by text <br>, 
  or biometric identification like a fingerprint.</p>
<h3>4. Maintain Device Security</h3>
<p>Install and update security software on your devices. This includes antivirus, 
  anti-spam, and spyware detection features. Regularly update your software <br>and devices 
  to protect against new threats.</p>
<h2>Safe Practices for Online Transactions</h2>
<h3>5. Use Your Own Device</h3>
<p>Avoid accessing your financial accounts from public computers or devices. If you must use 
  another computer, clear your browser’s cache and history <br>after logging out.</p>
<h3>6. Browse Carefully</h3>
<p>Ensure you are on a secure site when accessing financial accounts. Look for "https" in the 
  URL and a closed padlock icon. Avoid multitasking on multiple <br>webpages while logged in to 
  your accounts, and always log out when finished.</p>
<h3>7. Be Cyber Safe When Using Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>Avoid accessing your financial accounts over public Wi-Fi networks. Use trusted, encrypted 
  networks and secure your home Wi-Fi with a strong password <br>and encryption.</p>
<h2>Regular Monitoring and Prompt Action</h2>
<h3>8. Review All Correspondence From Your Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Regularly review your account activity and statements. Ensure your financial institution has 
  your current contact information. Report any unauthorized <br>activity immediately.</p>
<h3>Additional Actions</h3>
<p>If your accounts are breached, change your login information immediately. Place a fraud alert 
  on your credit file and seek additional resources on <br>identity theft from trusted organizations 
  like the Federal Trade Commission’s IdentityTheft.gov.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of cybercriminals accessing your 
  personal financial information and protect your financial well-<br>being.</p>
